The typical length of time for checking out a bike is likely longer than most would expect. Most riders use the bike share for four to six hours, suggesting extensive usage of the bikes for each share.

There is a noticeable difference between genders with respect to bike usage, as male bike usage often exceeds female usage. Female riders, however, tend to have longer checkout times.

Heavy usage time is typically at the start and end of the workday and on weekends. Morning and late afternoon high usage times suggest a relation to work commutes.

Unlike bike usage, the genders mirror in heavy usage times. Although not completely evident, the graphic suggests the closer to the weekend, the smaller the disparity in gender bike usage.

Subscriber status tells the story as subscriber usage greatly outpaces customer usage. Note gender differences are more noticeable among subscribers, and there are more unknown genders among customers.
